Hello and welcome to my new blog! 🐈

I am excited to share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings with you all on a variety of technology-related topics. In this post, I wanted to give you a little bit of background on my motivations for starting this blog, what you can expect to see in the future, and my tentative posting schedule.



## Summary

In this post, I will be discussing my motivations for starting this blog, my plans for future content, and my tentative posting schedule. I will also be welcoming feedback and comments from readers.

## Introduction

As I mentioned in my previous post, I was inspired to start this blog for a number of reasons. Firstly, I see it as a personal challenge to improve my writing skills and to share my knowledge and experiences with others. Secondly, I am always looking for ways to challenge myself and grow personally, and I believe that writing a blog will help me do that. Finally, I have a genuine passion for technology and am excited to explore new horizons in this field through my writing.

## Motivations

I came across the wonderful story of James Oliver, also known as @oliverspeaks, and was inspired by his open and candid approach to discussing his struggles with reading. His story really resonated with me, and it got me thinking about the importance of being open and honest about our challenges and struggles. This is one of the main motivations behind my decision to start this blog - to be open, honest, and vulnerable about my own experiences and challenges as I learn and grow in the field of technology.

[## Future Content

In the future, you can expect to see a variety of content on this blog. Some of the topics I am planning to cover include:

-   My favorite tools
-   Distro commentary (including Arch and Gnome)
-   Cataloging articles
-   Websites
-   Things I have learned
-   Any requests from readers
-   How I set up and disseminate my blog
